# Titanic-EDA
This project performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, investigating factors that influenced passenger survival rates during the disaster. The analysis utilizes Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to extract meaningful insights and build a basic predictive model.

Key Findings

Gender was the strongest predictor of survival, with females having much higher survival rates
Passenger class significantly influenced survival, with 1st class passengers having the best chances
Young children had better survival prospects compared to adults
Passengers with mid-sized families (3-4 members) had higher survival rates than those traveling alone or in very large groups
Fare paid correlated with survival rates, likely due to its relationship with passenger class and accommodation location on the ship
